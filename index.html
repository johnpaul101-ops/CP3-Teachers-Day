      <h3>Our Heartfelt Appreciation</h3>
      <div class="message__card">
        <p>
          We hope you are all doing well and staying healthy. A big, heartfelt
          thank you for everything you have done for us throughout this school
          year. Even though we, as your students, sometimes fall short, whether
          it is being a bit too noisy, slow to understand, or not always at our
          best, you never give up on us. Your patience, kindness, and dedication
          mean so much to us, and the way you continue to teach us with
          understanding and care inspires us to keep learning and improving
          every single day. The effort you put into making each lesson
          meaningful and fun shows how much you truly care, and it encourages us
          to do our best no matter the challenges. We are so grateful for all
          the time, guidance, and encouragement you share with us, and for
          believing in us even when we doubt ourselves. Thank you for always
          being ready to teach us, for cheering us on, and for helping us grow
          not only as students but also as people. We wish you good health,
          happiness, and success in everything you do, and we hope the joy and
          inspiration you give us return to you many times over!
